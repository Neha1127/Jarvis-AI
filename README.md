# 🤖 Jarvis-AI  
Your Personal Voice-Activated Assistant Built with Python  

---

⚡ **Jarvis-AI** 🧠  
Empowering your computer to understand and execute your voice commands — from playing music to searching the web, automating apps, and more — all using cutting-edge speech recognition and AI-driven logic.

Jarvis-AI is a **Python-based intelligent voice assistant** designed to interact naturally with users. It listens, interprets, and performs your spoken commands instantly — whether it’s playing music, searching online, opening applications, or telling you the time.

## 🚀 Key Features

🎤 **Voice Recognition Engine**  
Jarvis listens and accurately understands your voice commands using the SpeechRecognition library.

🗣️ **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
Speaks back to you in a natural voice using the pyttsx3 engine.

🔍 **Wikipedia Integration**  
Fetches short summaries and facts instantly from Wikipedia.

🎵 **Music Player**  
Plays your favorite local songs or playlists stored on your system.

🌐 **Web Search Automation**  
Automatically opens browser tabs for searches or websites you request.

🕓 **Time & Date Assistance**  
Jarvis can tell you the current time, date, and even greet you based on the hour of the day.

📁 **Application Control**  
Can open apps and system utilities (e.g., Notepad, Calculator, browser) directly via commands.

🧩 **Extensible Commands**  
Easily add new capabilities — you can teach Jarvis to do more by modifying or extending command logic.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step User Journey

### 1. Start Jarvis  
Run the main Python script and activate the assistant. Jarvis greets you and starts listening.

### 2. Speak a Command  
Say something like “Play music”, “Search Wikipedia for Machine Learning”, or “What time is it?”

### 3. AI Processes the Command  
Jarvis identifies the intent of your speech using keyword matching and processing logic.

### 4. Execute & Respond  
It executes the relevant task (opens app, plays song, fetches Wikipedia info) and speaks back the response.

### 5. Continue Conversation  
Jarvis remains active and ready for your next instruction — until you say “exit” or “stop”.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Neha1127/Jarvis-AI.git
cd Jarvis-AI
````

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

If you have a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, manually install core dependencies:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 wikipedia
```

### 4. Run the Assistant

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Listening** – The assistant uses your microphone to capture voice commands.
2. **Speech to Text** – Converts your spoken words into text via Google Speech API.
3. **Processing** – Parses keywords to determine the action (e.g., “play”, “open”, “search”).
4. **Execution** – Executes relevant system commands or API calls.
5. **Response** – Replies using a text-to-speech engine for natural feedback.
